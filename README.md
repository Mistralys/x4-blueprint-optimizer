# X4: Foundations blueprint sorter and optimizer

PHP-based tool to optimize and reorder X4: Foundations blueprint XML files.

The in-game station editor does not allow reordering modules to ensure that
they are built in a specific order. This script allows reordering modules, 
and to download an updated XML file to import into the game.
